# Graphs I want
# Summary graphs
# Counties with: highest and lowest graduation rates, highest and lowest parity ratios

# County examples
# Pick a county - put the parity index on the x axis and graduation rates on y (make one for each school year)
# I want to create a line graph that shows the relationship between parity scores and grad rates

# Time series graph
# Pick one county - and make a graph that looks like this

# Could be cool to use random generator to pick a county

# Time series graph showing state student teacher parity over time on one line and state graduation rates on the other (x-axis is school year, y-axis in parity, dots represent parity scores and graduation rates)



# Generating a random county
