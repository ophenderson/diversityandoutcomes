# diverstiyandoutcomes
## Hopefully, this repository will examine relationships between student outcomes and teacher diversity in the US, using South Carolina as the model. For the sake of simplicity, I'll only be looking at white students, black students, and hispanic/latinx students. It should look at SC data over time using data from SC department of education and SC report card, a website that partners with the SC education oversight committee.
### This is the step that I'm on: Gathering input files and cleaning data, making initial visualizations
### Using SC data for 180 days because this is the minimum number of instruction days that students must attend school in SC
